# Challenge Module 2

The module 2 analysis was revised based on Steve's notes to increase his research for the entire stock market.  In order to make the program run more efficiently, we evaluated and refactored the original code to create arrays for the volume, starting price, and ending prices.  We then defined a tickerIndex variable that was used to create a loop to process the results more effectively.
